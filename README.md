# Beijing-Air-Quality-Data-Analyze-dashboard
##Project objective
To analyze Beijing’s air quality data to identify pollution trends, understand the key factors affecting AQI(Air Quality Index) levels, and provide insights that help in monitoring air quality patterns and supporting environmental decision-making.
## DataSet used 
<a href="https://github.com/Shivani-46/Beijing-Air-Quality-Data-Analyze-dashboard/blob/main/AirQualityUCI.xlsx">Dataset</a>

## Dashboard Questions
-Created a slicer on Date and Time. 

-Created a card on the hottest date.

-Plot a stacked bar chart on avg of non methane,avg of nitrous oxide ,avg of nitrogen dioxide.

-Created a card on most humid day.

-A line chart on average of CO by month. 

-Dashboard Interaction <a href="https://github.com/Shivani-46/Beijing-Air-Quality-Data-Analyze-dashboard/blob/main/air%20quality%20dashboard.png">View Dashboard</a>

## Project Insight
-Pollution levels are higher in winter months and lower in summer.
-CO and nitrogen-related pollutants show clear seasonal patterns.
-The dashboard highlights the hottest day and most humid day from the dataset.
-The dashboard highlights the hottest day and most humid day from the dataset.

## Final Conclusion:-
The analysis shows that Beijing’s air quality changes with the seasons, with pollution levels being highest in winter and lowest in summer. Key pollutants like CO and nitrogen compounds rise during colder months. The dashboard also helps identify important days such as the hottest and most humid, giving a better understanding of how weather conditions affect air quality. Overall, the project provides clear insights into pollution patterns and environmental conditions in Beijing.
